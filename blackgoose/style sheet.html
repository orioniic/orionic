<h1>Cooking with Our Chef!</h1>

<p>Our wonderful chef has cooked with pride our various apetizers and sides that we offer here at the Black Goose Bistro! We are pleased to give you a chance at some insight at how our wonderful chef prepares our meals.</p>

<p>Our food would never be as good if we didn't have our chef! They use special recipes (BGB family secret ;) ) and love to create the famous pizzas and salads that keep you coming back each and every time! </p>
<h2>Six-hour Salad</h2>

<p><img src="salads.jpg" alt="Smoked tomato salads on plates"></p>

<p>Our chef prepares our salads with arugula, smoked tomatoes, tomato jam, and grilled avocado (it's as good as it sounds!). Some of us jokingly call it "6-hour Salad" because that's how long he works on it!The fresh tomatoes are slowly smoked over woodchips in the grill, and when they are softened, out chef separates out the seeds which he reduces into a smoky jam. The tomatoes are cut into strips to put on the salads. Soon, the avacados are finally put  on the grill. Then we wait for the perfect grill marks!</p>

<p> We wrote up a streamlined adaptation of his recipe that requires <em>much</em> less time and serves 6 people instead of <em>five</em> times that amount!</p>


<h2 style="color: gray">The Main Course</h2>

<p>In addition to the smoky grilled salad, we serve  tarragon cornish hens with a cognac cream sauce loaded with chanterelles and grapes, and wild rice with grilled ramps (wild garlicky leeks).</p>


<p> You will leave our Bistro with full bellies and full hearts!</p>
